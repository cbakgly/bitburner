Bitburner script for fun.

Have fun: https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner


### Howto
Current script cover basic automation (with bug :) on game bootstraping.

But at very beginning, you have only a home server of 4g mem which can't 
run many scripts at once,where v1 script just works well.

After buying more mem, say 16g, automation script will be power up.

Hacknet server will get you a good payback, if run and leave it for several days.
But once you get augments, hacking earning goes up dramatically, leaves hacknet useless.

By now, I haven't touched many other aspects in game like stock, formulas and singularity.
Scripts will not be updated untill then.
