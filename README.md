Bitburner script for fun.

### Spoiler

The fun will be greatly diminished by using these too earlier.

### Howto
Current script cover basic automation (with bug :) on game bootstrapping.

But at the very beginning, you have only a home server of 4g mem which can't 
run many scripts at once, where the v1 script just works well.

After buying more mem, say 16g, the automation script will be power up.

Hacknet server will get you a good payback if run and leave it for several days.
But once you get augments, hacking earnings go up dramatically, leaving Hacknet useless.

I haven't touched many other aspects of the game like stock, formulas, and singularity. More scripts will be added here.

#### Usage

Referring to the bootstrap.js, manually run scripts line by line if the mem is not enough to run.

```
run copy.js # copy hack.js to every server.

run nuke.js # get admin right on every hackable server.

run runhack-on-target.js # hack money 
```
